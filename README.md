## Canonical Contractual JSON

> Ordered & animated JSON unlocks a world of possibilities!

`ccsjon` is a *sax-style* parser and ordered resolver for JSON that adds a thin layer of *entities*, *inheritance* and *relationships* animated by declared JavaScript module implementations.

[Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_schema_pattern) because you get the *same* entities no matter how source declarations are linked making a *virtual entity* the primary unit of composition vs the actual JSON document.

[Contractual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) because you have complete control over declared inheritance and relationship boundaries within the entity implementing JavaScript modules.
